This is a code for a tic tac toe game which one can play in command line. I have used c++ to write it. As a begginer writing this would help enhance
one's logic building.It is a two-player game which are assigned a character(X or O). They play on a 3x3 grid, whoever has their three consecutive characters in line first
wins.
